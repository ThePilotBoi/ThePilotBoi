 Hi, I’m @ThePilotBoi! I’m interested in Linux (debian and fedora), bunny rabbits, aviation and ham radio!     I like ricing linux desktops. so check my repos for dotfiles and check my reddit posts on r/unixporn.
     I'm pretty new to programming, so don't expect much from me... If you want to reach me have a look at these: .ThePilotBoi#2734 discord / guilded.gg/thepilotboi / u/Linuxguy5 |
